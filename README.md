# Overview

![Build Status][github-build-badge] [![codecov][codecov-badge]](https://codecov.io/gh/ixm-one/toolkit)

This is a simple set of wrappers around commonly used operations between all of
IXM's GitHub Actions. This code is under the MIT License. It is also
published directly to GitHub's NPM Package Repository. It is not intended to
be used outside of IXM's GitHub Actions. Said actions are distributed as
single-execution 'scripts', and thus needing to distribute this library with
them is unnecessary.
